## MongoDB Connection and Data Handling

### Setup and Mock Data

- Connected to MongoDB and installed a mock data set called `users`.

### Testing Functionality

- Created a test Python file for MongoDB named `mongo_test.py` to understand and verify the functionality.

- [mongo_test.py](server/mongo_test.py)


### Back-End Implementation

- Developed a Flask application that:
  - Reads the database client.
  - Pulls the `users` data from the database.
  - Converts the data to JSON format.
  - Returns the JSON data at the `@index` route.

  - [server.py](server/server.py)
  - [veidaai/app/page.js](veidaai/app/page.js)

### Front-End Integration

- The front end reads the JSON data returned by the Flask application.
- Verified that the integration works well.

### Future Considerations

- Need to start thinking about infrastructure for managing users within the database.

**That's all for now.**
